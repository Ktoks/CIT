The C program starts out in main
It checks and parses the command-line arguments.
It initializes the Lua environment and registers C functions that can be called from Lua
It calls a Lua function to drive the rest of the process
The Lua code calls a C function to load the input file, returning it as Lua string
The Lua code calls a C function to parse the input string. It passes in the string and an offset (see
below) and gets back a single new token and a new offset. It calls this many times, resulting in a list of
tokens in Lua.
The Lua code generates n-grams, then shingles, then a table of prefixes mapped to last words (see
below).
The Lua code babbles the requested number of words to the console
