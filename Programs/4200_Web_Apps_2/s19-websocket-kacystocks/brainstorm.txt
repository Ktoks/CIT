my idea:
    game of life

    create an app that takes events that some user inputs to get points
    in life to put toward something that that user values, such as buying
    something that the user likes, the points are basically a currency

    this could be used to motivate people who have trouble being motivated 
    due to various health issues

    ?? walk the user through a tutorial how to add a resource add-on ??

    resources:
        users:
            each user will have:
                name
                goals
                    milestones (which are miniature goals to reach the big ones)
                    ?? progress bar ??
                score
                reminders (which show up throughout the day in their own field)
                quotes
            suggested add-ons:
                height
                weight
                addictions
                bad behaviors
                road bumps to overcome
