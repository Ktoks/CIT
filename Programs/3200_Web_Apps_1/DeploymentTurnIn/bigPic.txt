Server Types

finish this by friday!!!!!!!

Procfile will tell Heroku how to open the server.py file

PaaS:
    Heroku
    Google App Engine
    AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    :: differs from virtual because:
        backed up onto a virtual server
        pre-configured instances for your particular setup
        very specific for your requirements
        they handle the backend for you
        they scale it for you
        make sure it's secure, updated, and handle it all for you

    pros:
        easier
        lots of control still
        software headache is removed
        modern godaddy
    cons:
        more expensive
        may not support everything yet

containers:
    real-time server instances (5 minutes) or as needed
    efficient with time and money
    spins up and down PaaS quickly


both below are evolved from PaaS
Serverless:
    functions as a Services
    microfunctions
    charged only for the time that it takes your code to execute
    industrial experimentation
    it's uncomfortable for some devs
    basically you write the code, we take care of it

(know pros and cons of these)
Virtual Servers:
    Linode:                                 linux virtual machines
    Digital Ocean:      
    EC2 (AWS):                              Amazon Web Services
    Cloud Compute/Google Compute Engine:    High-end

Physical Servers:
    data center     :: reliable power and internet connection
    bedroom
    dell computer/server
    IOT             :: internet of things
        -Raspberry Pi

Shared
    godaddy.com
    wordpress
    :: limited, security is bad, cheap, easy



give step 4 time
