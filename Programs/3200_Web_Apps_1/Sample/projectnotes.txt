So I think I'm going to make a chore chart thing that 
can be  used by roommates, families, or could be implemented
in a business setting -for indevidual 'jobs'.

It's functionality will be as follows:

It will have a database that contains a list of chores/'jobs'.

It will have the ability to append to the database.

On a button click, it will assign a random 'job' to each
    'worker'until all 'jobs' are done.

Another database will hold as many names as necissary 
    for 'workers'.

It will keep a history of those who were assigned chores
    and display those unfinished until checked off by
    'workers'.
